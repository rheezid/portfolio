### Data Science 

[EDA, Preprocessing, Feature Selection, Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rheezid/eda-preprocessing-feature-selection-modeling)
A group project as part of our Data Science Bootcamp assessment. In this project, we are required to understand the data given, identify which activities should be done, analyze the data using exploratory and visualization, do the data-preprocessing, as well as develop model which relevant with the problem along with the evaluation within a predetermined period of time.
In this project we are using feature selection with LASSO to optimize the model. We will then use the selected features on three models, tune the hyperparameters, and evaluate them to find best performing model.
