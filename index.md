### Machine Learning 

- [Customer Churn: EDA, Preprocessing, Feature Selection, Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rheezid/eda-preprocessing-feature-selection-modeling)  
A group project to predict the probability of churning customers, as part of our Data Science Bootcamp assessment. In this project we conducted feature selection with LASSO, then used the selected features on three models, tuned the hyperparameters, and evaluated them to find best performing model.
